This function will take in either a object of class data.frame and a using a second dataframe with a list of all the metabolite identifed, will return the CRS score for all the bins. this could work with other metabolite identifiers; for example bins with the name of the     metabolite, as  log as they are unique. mistakes could happen when greple take NAD and NADH
